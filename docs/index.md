development of data-driven models for environmental and economic
variables over East Africa. Collected and curated satellite imagery
and other large-scale geospatial datasets for the region using both
Amazon S3 and an in-house CKAN data portal. Distributed results with
data visualizations and graphical model-assessments in Jupyter

researchers on reproducible workflows for data synthesis, analysis,
and visualization using scripted pipelines in R and Python. Courses
taught primarily at SESYNC but also at local universities and one
international scientific conference. Data scientist participant on
inter-disciplinary research teams funded by SESYNC, primarily
responsible for planning and designing approaches to synthesize
datasets: including geospatial raster and vector datasets, high
resolution time-series observations, experimental results, and
free-form text/unstructured data. Coding performed primarily in R on
the Center's self-hosted RStudio Server. Worked with IT to launch a
parallel Jupyter Hub server to encourage Python based projects. As
Senior Data Scientist, additionally supervised two data scientists and
two graduate assistants.

and network modeling. Designed and populated a PostgreSQL database of
cattle market records (county-of-origin and price) scraped from
websites using automated pipelines coded in Python. Developed Bayesian
predictive models of cattle trade networks for epidemic inference. Managed
and taught Python to five undergraduate and masters student research
assistants.

| *Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution* |         $57,000 |

Competitive 18-month scholarship awarded for research on phytoplankton
population dynamics. Used machine learning to classify marine
phytoplankton from *in-situ* microscopic imagery, with a novel
probabilistic interpretation of random forests. Utilized GPU for
parallel computations. Submitted NSF proposal to couple automatically
classified cell images to phytoplankton community model and
accommodate classification errors using particle filtering.

| **Research Assistant**                              | 2005-03/2006-06 |
| *Heinz Center for Science, Economics & Environment* |         $30,000 |

Designed and created data visualizations for sections of the "State of
the Nation's Ecosystems" report on non-native and invasive
species. Researched and authored internal report on data gaps for
air-quality indicators.

| **Biological Field Technician (0404)** | 2004-06/2004-12 |
| *US Forest Service*                    |                 |

Carried out field work in remote regions of the Sierra Nevada,
surveying threatened amphibian species and their habitat. Entered data
in MS Access database and created population status maps in
ArcGIS. Required to carry 50lbs of equipment at altitudes of 10-12K
feet over 25 miles from nearest road access.
